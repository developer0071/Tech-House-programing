🏪 Tech House – Household Appliance Store (Python)
📌 Project Overview

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read this README.

This project, Tech House, is my first major programming assignment for PDP University, and it represents the beginning of my journey into software development. The goal of this project was to design and implement a functional, console-based application that simulates the operations of a real household appliance store using Python.

The system demonstrates how core programming concepts such as object-oriented design, data handling, and user interaction can be applied to solve real-world business problems in a simple but structured way.

🏪 About Tech House

Tech House is a console-based Python application that simulates the operation of a household appliance store. The system supports two main user roles:

Customers, who can browse products, manage a shopping cart, and place orders.

Administrators, who can manage products, stock, customers, and sales data.

The application focuses on clarity, logic, and usability rather than graphical interfaces, making it ideal for learning backend logic and system structure.
